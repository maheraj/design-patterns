# Prototype pattern - creational Pattern
The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development.
It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.
The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations.
