# Builder pattern in Java
Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

The Builder is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the Gang of Four design patterns.

Example:
* StringBuilder
* Document Builder


## When it is used
* Immutable
* Static Inner Class
* It can use external Builder class as well to handle legacy code
* Handle Complex construction

## Pitfalls
* Not that much
* For Immutable Object
* Designed First
