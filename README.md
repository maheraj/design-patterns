# Software Design Patterns
Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers.

## Types of Design Patterns
There are mainly three types of design patterns:
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

### Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. Two types:
* Class creational patterns - While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process
* Object creational patterns - use delegation effectively to get the job done

### Structural
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. They are:
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Private Class Data and 
* Proxy

### Behavioral
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these pattern. Behavioral patterns are:
* Chain of responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Null Object
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template method
* Visitor
